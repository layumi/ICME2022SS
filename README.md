## Abstract:

With the aim of provision of high-quality information, services and items to users, advanced Internet and multimedia services have experienced an exponential growth and advanced rapidly over the past decades. A huge amount of user-generated and service provider-generated multimedia data become available. These data are heterogeneous and multi-modal in nature, imposing great challenges for processing and analyzing them. Multi-modal data consist of a mixture of various types of data from different modalities such as texts, images, videos, audios etc. Data-driven correlational representation and knowledge-guided learning are the main scientific problems for multimedia analysis. 

This special session aims at bringing together researchers and professionals from academia and industry from around the world for showcasing, discussing, and reviewing the whole spectrum of technological opportunities, challenges, solutions, and emerging applications in knoweldge-driven multi-modal deep analysis for multimedia,. We especially encourage original work based on interdisciplinary research, such as computer science and social science, where quantitative evidence is available demonstrating the mutual advantage of such an approach. 

**Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to:**

* Multi-modal representation learning with knowledge
* Multi-modal data fusion with knowledge 
* Knowledge representation for multi-modal data  
* Deep cross-modality alignment with knowledge
* Methodology and architectures to improve model explainability with knowledge
* Multi-modal deep analysis for innovative multimedia applications, such as person reidentification, social network analysis, cross-modal retrieval, recommendation systems and so on.

## Important Dates

**Submission of papers:**

* New Regular Paper Submission deadline: December 13, 2020[11:59 p.m. PST]
* Paper acceptance notification: March 6, 2021

## Conference and Journal Papers

***The special session submission site is open and can be accessed at <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICME2021">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICME2021</a>. Under "Create New Submission", the authors need to choose the "subject area" as the desired "special session x", so the papers can be counted as special sessions.  If they choose other subject areas, the papers will belong to the main program.***

All papers presented at ICME 2021 will be included in IEEE Xplore. All papers submitted to this special session will go through the same review process as the regular papers submitted to the main conference to ensure that the contributions are of high quality. If a special session has more than 5 papers being accepted, some of the papers will be moved to the regular paper sessions of the conference.
The IEEE Transactions on Multimedia is partnering with IEEE ICME. Extended versions of the top-ranked ICME 2021 papers will be invited for submission and potential publication in the IEEE Transactions on Multimedia and IEEE Open Journal of Circuits and Systems. We invite authors to submit high-quality contributions aiming at taking part in this call and to have the opportunity to publish an extended ICME paper in this prestigious journal. After the due review process, if your paper is highly ranked, the Technical Program Committee Chairs will get in touch with you regarding the next steps.
